U. S. RANGER IS CHAMPION COYOTE KILLER

Jack McEntire,-Forest Ranger, Holding 50 Coyote Pelts, All of Which He Killed in the (Vlalhetir Forest Reserve.
Portland, Ore., Feb.. 24.
Uncle Sam's forest rangers who patrol (the great western reserves and protect them from fire voluntarily hunt down wild animals that prey upon sheep, which graze by the thousands within the forest reserves during the open seasons. The coyote, first cousin of the wolf, is the. most numerous and' pernicious of the lot. Coyotes attack a flock and, for the fiendish love of kill
ing, slay helpless sheep right- arid left. Because of their great speed, cunning, and keen ears, they are hard to catch. Jack McEntire, ranger in the Malheur forest reserve in Oregon, holds the record for killing coyotes. During last year he shot more than 100, thereby saving three- or four times that many sheep.
